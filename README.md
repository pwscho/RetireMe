How It Works
The engine produces a flat list of ResultRow objects:

Code
Year | AccountId | Category | Value | HouseholdId | ScenarioId
This structure keeps memory usage low and makes charting, exporting, and scenario comparison straightforward.

Development Philosophy
Transparent, explicit logic

Reproducible results

Scenario isolation

Minimal allocations and clean data flow

Easy annual updates to tax and market data
