RetireMe — Simple User’s Guide
RetireMe is a retirement‑planning simulator that helps you explore different financial scenarios, compare outcomes, and understand how your savings, income, and spending evolve over time. This guide walks you through each part of the app and explains how to run simulations and interpret the results.

1. Getting Started
When you open RetireMe, you’ll see two main areas:

Left Sidebar — Scenario Manager  
This is where you create, copy, and delete scenarios.

Main Area — Tabs  
Each tab lets you enter different parts of your financial picture: accounts, income, Social Security, withdrawals, Roth conversions, and results.

2. Managing Scenarios
A scenario is a complete set of assumptions—your accounts, spending, Social Security, income, and more.

Add a Scenario
Click Add to create a new blank scenario.

Copy a Scenario
Click Copy to duplicate the selected scenario.
This is useful when you want to compare “what‑if” versions (e.g., retire at 62 vs. 67).

Delete a Scenario
Click Delete to remove the selected scenario.

3. Scenario Tab
This tab defines the overall settings for your simulation:

Base Year — The first year of the simulation.

Years to Calculate — How long the simulation runs.

Annual Spending — Your planned yearly spending (base spending, additional spending is in withdrawal tab).

Inflation Rate — How spending grows over time (applies to base spending only, not to additional spending).

Spending Strategy:

	Fixed: Uses your chosen inflation rate every year.

	Historical: Uses real historical inflation (if running a historical and Monte Carlo simulations).

Rebalance Annually — If checked, your accounts are rebalanced to your target equity percentage once per year.

This tab sets the “big picture” assumptions.

4. Accounts Tab
Here you enter your financial accounts (additional spouse accounts are generated automatically when you check "Married" box). Each account includes:

Owner (You or Spouse)

Tax Bucket

Taxable

Tax Deferred (Traditional IRA/401k)

Tax Free (Roth)

Asset Class

Equities

Bonds

Cash

Starting Value

Rate of Return (anticipated average annual return for the account) (Historical and Monte Carlo simulations will override this with historical returns or simulated returns)

Priority (prioritizes which accounts get withrawn form in order.)

These accounts are the foundation of the simulation. The engine tracks balances year‑by‑year, applies growth, withdrawals, RMDs, and inheritance rules.

5. Social Security Tab
Enter Social Security details for each person:

Current Age

Claim Age

Death Age

Benefit at Full Retirement Age

COLA (Cost‑of‑Living Adjustment)

The simulator automatically:

Applies COLA increases starting at age 62

Adjusts benefits for early or late claiming

Deposits benefits into your cash account each year

6. Income Tab
Use this tab to add other income streams, such as:

Pensions

Part‑time work

Rental income

Annuities

For each income stream, you specify:

Owner

Start age

End age

Annual amount

Whether it is taxable

The simulator deposits this income into your cash account each year.

7. Withdrawals Tab
Here you define planned withdrawals that supplement your base spending (no inflation is applied).

Each withdrawal stream includes:

Owner

Start age

End age

Annual amount

These amounts are added to your spending need for the year.

8. Roth Conversions Tab
Use this tab to schedule Roth conversions.

For each conversion:

Owner

Start age

End age

Annual conversion amount

The simulator:

Withdraws from tax‑deferred accounts

Moves the amount into Roth accounts

Adds the conversion to taxable income

9. Results Tab
After running a simulation, this tab displays the year‑by‑year results.

You’ll see:

Balances
Starting balance

Ending balance

Investment return

Income
Social Security

Other income

Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)

Roth conversions

Spending & Withdrawals
Base spending

Added spending

Total withdrawals

Percent of portfolio withdrawn

Taxes
Taxable income

Ordinary income

Capital gains

Taxes due

IRMAA (Medicare surcharge, if applicable)

Account‑Level Details
For each account:

Starting value

Ending value

Investment return

This gives you a complete picture of how your retirement finances evolve.

10. Running a Simulation
Simulations run automatically when you view the Results tab or when the app triggers a recalculation.

Behind the scenes, the engine:

Pays last year’s taxes

Deposits Social Security and income

Calculates spending need

Withdraws funds using your withdrawal strategy

Applies RMDs

Applies Roth conversions

Handles inheritance if someone reaches their death age

Applies investment growth

Computes taxes for the year

Records all results

You don’t need to manage any of this manually—the app handles it for you.

11. Tips for Best Use
Use Copy Scenario to compare different retirement ages or spending levels.

Keep account tax buckets accurate—taxes and RMDs depend on them.

Review the Percent Withdrawals column to see if your plan is sustainable.

Use Roth conversions strategically to manage future RMDs and taxes.

Tax data, Scenario data, RMD table, and Market Historical Data are all stored in individual JSON files.
